# music_popularity_prediction
This project uses Spotify data and python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and other to find a correlation between a soundtrack's 'Popularity' and its various features. It further uses this information to predict the Popularity score for future soundtracks.

Pandas library is used to read the csv file and a complete list of all the features associated with each track alongwith its count and data type is as shown below:

To gain initial perspective, we take 5 features and use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to visualise the relation between each of these and the target variable 'Popularity'.  The scatter plots are shown below:
